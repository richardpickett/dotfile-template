# All algorithm in /proc/crypto are supported but only lzo/lz4 have zramctl text strings.
# lz4 is the fastest whilst deflate(zlib) has much better text compression.
# mem_limit is compressed memory limit and will set a hard memory limit for sys admin.
# disk_size is virtual uncompressed size approx 220-450% of mem allocated depending on algorithm and input file.
# Much higher than the compression alg is capable will waste mem as there is an approx 0.1% mem overhead even when empty.
# swap_priority set zram over alternative swap devices.
# page-cluster 0 means tuning to singular pages rather than default 3 which caches 8 for HDD tuning, which can lower latency.
# swappiness 80 due to improved performance of zram allows more usage without effect of raising from default 60.
# Can be up to 100 but will increase process queue on intense load such as boot.
# zram_dir is the directory you wish to hold in zram, the original is moved to a bind mount bind_dir and is synchronised on start/stop and write commands.
# bind_dir is a directory where the original dir will be mounted for sync purposes. Usually in /opt or /var, name optional.
# oldlog_dir will enable logrotation to an off device directory whilst retaining only live logs in zram. Usually in /opt or /var, name optional.
# If you need multiple zram swaps or zram dirs just create another entry in /ect/ztab.
# Stop the service sudo service zram-config stop edit /etc/ztab sudo nano /etc/ztab start the service sudo service zram-config start
